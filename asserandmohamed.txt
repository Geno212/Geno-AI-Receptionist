Big win for Ahmed El-Sewedy’s Elsewedy Electric as it powers up one of Egypt’s most ambitious infrastructure projects.

The Egyptian industrial giant has secured a major contract to deliver HVAC systems for Egypt’s new 660-km high-speed rail network.

In partnership with Johnson Controls–Hitachi, Elsewedy will supply and install over 3,000 high-efficiency units, a move that boosts its infrastructure and energy footprint across the MENA region.

The mega rail line will connect Cairo, Alexandria, Alamein, Ain Sokhna, and 6th of October City, serving over 1 million passengers and 8,500 tons of cargo daily.

This contract comes on the heels of a strong first quarter for Elsewedy Electric, with $1.2 billion in revenue and deals expanding its Gulf presence, including Qatar and THOMASSEN Service.
